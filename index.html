      <p id="BadmintonInfo" class="info"> I love Badminton. I am playing badminton since 3 years. I used to play tennis but my sister started playing badminton, so I did too. Everyday I go for badminton coaching for 2 hrs. Even while exams are there Me and my sisters do not miss any class. I go to VKBA (Varun Khanwalkar Badminton Academy) for coaching. All the coaches there are super friendly and teach really nicely. On Saturday's there is a League known as Saturday league. It is like a tournament. I have played 3 tournaments(not saturday league). I have not won any but I have reached the quarter finals in the Amanora Tournament. I hope you enjoyed reading about my first hobby, don't forget to read about my second one. </p>

      <p class="info"> I love coding as well. I learn coding from WhiteHat Jr. I did my trial class on 24 August 2020. When I was small I wanted to make a app or game, but, my father told me that i need to learn coding for that. In 2020 I saw many ads of WhiteHat Jr and I really wanted to join it. I convinced my father a lot and then I joined! On September 2  2020 I joined WhiteHat Jr. It has been 7.5 Months since I started coding. Whenever I am free, I open my laptop and start coding. I also teach coding on my Youtube Channel - Code With Samiksha. Do Check it out!! </p>
